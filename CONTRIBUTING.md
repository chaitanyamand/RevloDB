# Contributing to RevloDB

First off, thank you for considering contributing to RevloDB! We welcome any help, from reporting bugs to submitting new features.

## How to Contribute

We use the standard GitHub **fork and pull request** workflow. If you're new to this, here's a quick guide.

1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RevloDB.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/MyNewFeature`
4.  **Make your changes** and commit them with a clear, descriptive message.
5.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin feature/MyNewFeature`
6.  **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to our `main` branch.

## Code Quality and Style

To maintain code quality and consistency, we use automated checks on every pull request.

- **Linter:** We use **GitHub Super-Linter** to enforce code style and catch common errors.
- **Security:** We use **GitHub CodeQL** to scan for potential security vulnerabilities.
- **AI Code Review:** We use **CodeRabbit** to automatically review pull requests. It provides suggestions on code logic, best practices, and potential improvements.

Please review the feedback from all automated tools and make the necessary changes before requesting a final review.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create an issue in the "Issues" tab of the repository. Include as much detail as possible:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature, feel free to open an issue to discuss it. This is a great way to get feedback before you start working on a pull request.

Thank you for your contribution!
