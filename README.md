## üìñ About the Project

RevloDB is a datastore designed for applications that require a complete history of their data. It provides a straightforward key-value interface, but with a powerful difference: **every change is preserved**.

This allows you to easily track, audit, and revert your data to any previous state, making it ideal for managing configurations, user profiles, content, and any data where history matters.

## ‚ú® Project Goals

- **Simple API:** Offer an intuitive, easy-to-learn interface for getting, setting, and querying data history.
- **High Performance:** Aims to be fast and efficient for common use cases.
